In the banking industries the loans are the most important element of every banks. The main profit for the bank comes directly from the loanâ€™s interest.
In this project we have to predict whether the person is eligible for the loan according to given criteria like Gender, Marital Status , Education , Applicant Income etc. of Applicant information.For that prediction we use different machine learning models and graphical presentation is done.

# Data Description : 
The dataset used for this study has been taken from the Kaggle.com website. There are total 614 observations and 13 variables to study. To Predict loan approved or not is based on crieterias like Gender, Marital Status, Education , Applicant Income, Loan Amount , Coaplicant Income, Self Employed Like that.



# Objective :

The main purpose of this project is to build various machine learning models that can predict whether applicant are eligible for loan or not based on different criterias.
To check which model is best fit for the data set.

# Conclusion : 
Here Logistic Regression model is good fitted for the dataset.
